[AmneziaWG](https://docs.amnezia.org/) VPN server and client in one container. It writes the server config and hands you a ready config plus QR code for every peer, and it can answer DNS for connected clients. Built on [LinuxServer.io](https://www.linuxserver.io/) base images with s6-overlay.

AmneziaWG is WireGuard with added traffic obfuscation, so deep packet inspection has a harder time recognizing the handshake. The container picks random obfuscation values on first start, including the I1-I5 protocol signatures, then saves them and reuses them on later restarts so already distributed peer configs keep working.

## Quick start

Server mode, three peers, using Docker Compose:

```yaml
services:
  amneziawg:
    image: ghcr.io/ayastrebov/docker-amneziawg:latest
    container_name: amneziawg
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
      # - SYS_MODULE  # rarely needed, see Parameters
    devices:
      - /dev/net/tun:/dev/net/tun
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Etc/UTC
      - SERVERURL=vpn.example.com
      - SERVERPORT=51820 #optional
      - PEERS=laptop,phone,tablet
      - PEERDNS=auto #optional
      - INTERNAL_SUBNET=10.13.13.0 #optional
      - ALLOWEDIPS=0.0.0.0/0, ::/0 #optional
      - PERSISTENTKEEPALIVE_PEERS=all #optional
      - LOG_CONFS=true #optional
      # - AWG_VERSION=2.0 #optional
      # - AWG_RANDOM_TRAILERS=on #optional
      # - AWG_DISABLE_COOKIES=on #optional
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
    ports:
      - 51820:51820/udp
    sysctls:
      - net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
      - net.ipv4.conf.all.src_valid_mark=1
    restart: unless-stopped
```

```bash
docker compose up -d
docker exec amneziawg /app/show-peer laptop   # config text and QR code
```

Each peer also gets a file on disk, at `./config/peer_laptop/peer_laptop.conf` for named peers or `./config/peer1/peer1.conf` when `PEERS` is a number.

The same thing with `docker run`:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name amneziawg \
  --cap-add NET_ADMIN \
  `# --cap-add SYS_MODULE  rarely needed, see Parameters` \
  --device /dev/net/tun:/dev/net/tun \
  -e PUID=1000 \
  -e PGID=1000 \
  -e TZ=Etc/UTC \
  -e SERVERURL=vpn.example.com \
  -e PEERS=3 \
  -p 51820:51820/udp \
  -v ./config:/config \
  --sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 \
  --sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.src_valid_mark=1 \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ghcr.io/ayastrebov/docker-amneziawg:latest
```

## Requirements

- A Docker host with `/dev/net/tun` and the `NET_ADMIN` capability
- amd64 (x86-64) or arm64 (aarch64)

### Kernel module

The container works out of the box without a kernel module: it falls back to the bundled `amneziawg-go` userspace implementation. For better throughput, install the [AmneziaWG kernel module](https://github.com/amnezia-vpn/amneziawg-linux-kernel-module) on the host and the container will detect it and use it instead.

Keep the module and the image on the same feature generation. An older module still works with a newer image, but the kernel datapath only applies the options that module knows about.

> [!NOTE]
> `SYS_MODULE` is not required for the kernel datapath. The container never calls `modprobe`, it only checks whether the module is already loaded. See [Parameters](#parameters) for the one case where `SYS_MODULE` still helps.

## Modes

The container runs in one of two modes, decided by whether `PEERS` is set.

Set `PEERS` and you get server mode. The container generates keys, writes `wg0.conf`, writes one config and QR code per peer, and starts unbound so peers on `PEERDNS=auto` have a resolver to talk to.

Leave `PEERS` unset and you get client mode. Drop your own `.conf` files into `./config/wg_confs/` and the container brings up every one of them on start. Nothing is generated, and unbound stays off unless you ask for it.

```bash
# client mode: your configs, nothing generated
docker run -d \
  --name amneziawg \
  --cap-add NET_ADMIN \
  --device /dev/net/tun:/dev/net/tun \
  -v ./config:/config \
  --sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 \
  --sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.src_valid_mark=1 \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ghcr.io/ayastrebov/docker-amneziawg:latest
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| `-p 51820:51820/udp` | WireGuard port |
| `-e PUID=1000` | User ID for file ownership |
| `-e PGID=1000` | Group ID for file ownership |
| `-e TZ=Etc/UTC` | Timezone ([list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones#List)) |
| `-e SERVERURL=auto` | Server URL/IP for peer configs. `auto` detects external IP |
| `-e SERVERPORT=51820` | Port advertised to peers. Use <= 9999 if your ISP blocks high UDP ports |
| `-e PEERS=3` | Number or comma-separated names (`laptop,phone`). Enables server mode |
| `-e PEERDNS=auto` | DNS for peers. `auto` = container's unbound resolver at subnet.1 |
| `-e INTERNAL_SUBNET=10.13.13.0` | VPN subnet (.1 = server, .2+ = peers) |
| `-e ALLOWEDIPS=0.0.0.0/0, ::/0` | Traffic peers route into the tunnel. The tunnel itself is IPv4-only, so `::/0` is included deliberately: it sinks client IPv6 instead of forwarding it, which prevents IPv6 leaks on dual-stack client networks. Drop `::/0` if you would rather peers keep using their native IPv6 outside the tunnel, or narrow the value to specific subnets for split-tunnel routing |
| `-e PERSISTENTKEEPALIVE_PEERS=` | Which peers get keepalive: `all` or comma-separated names/numbers |
| `-e SERVER_ALLOWEDIPS_PEER_X=` | Per-peer server AllowedIPs for site-to-site VPN |
| `-e LOG_CONFS=true` | Show generated configs and QR codes in container logs |
| `-e USE_DNS=true` | Enable or disable the built-in unbound resolver. Defaults to `true` in server mode and `false` in client mode. Auto-disables when port 53 is already bound, unless you set it explicitly. Setting it to `false` in server mode breaks DNS for peers on `PEERDNS=auto`, so point `PEERDNS` at a public resolver such as `1.1.1.1` if you do |
| `-e AWG_VERSION=2.0` | Protocol version: `2.0` (default, full DPI evasion), `3.0` (header protection and randomized timers), `3.1` (3.0 plus `RandomTrailers`) or `1.5` (legacy) |
| `-e AWG_RANDOM_TRAILERS=` | `on`/`off`. Pads handshake packets to a random length. Works with any `AWG_VERSION`; defaults to `on` under `3.1`. Must match on every end. `off` omits the key |
| `-e AWG_DISABLE_COOKIES=` | `on`/`off`. Stops cookie-reply messages under load. Works with any `AWG_VERSION`; always opt-in. Does not need to match. `off` omits the key |
| `-v /config` | Persistent config volume |
| `--cap-add NET_ADMIN` | Required for tunnel management |
| `--cap-add SYS_MODULE` | Usually unnecessary. The container does not load kernel modules, it only checks whether `wireguard`/`amneziawg` is already loaded on the host. Keep `SYS_MODULE` only on minimal hosts that do not auto-load iptables NAT modules |
| `--sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1` | Enable IP forwarding |
| `--device /dev/net/tun` | TUN device access |

## Protocol version

| Version | When to use |
|---------|-------------|
| `2.0` (default) | Full DPI evasion with I1-I5 signatures. Requires AmneziaVPN app 4.8.12.9+ |
| `3.0` | Adds header protection (`HeaderProtectionKey`), content padding and randomized protocol timers. Requires 3.0-capable clients, and `HeaderProtectionKey` must be identical on server and all clients |
| `3.1` | Everything `3.0` generates, plus `RandomTrailers = on`. Requires 3.1-capable software on every end. `DisableCookies` stays off unless you ask for it |
| `1.5` | Legacy compatibility with older clients. No I1-I5, S3=S4=0 |

Set this with the `AWG_VERSION` environment variable. Every obfuscation value is randomized for you, so override them only to match an existing setup.

Like the obfuscation parameters, the version is saved to `/config/server/awg_params` and restored when the variable is absent, so recreating a container from a compose file that no longer sets it keeps the deployment on the version its peer confs were built for.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `AWG_VERSION=3.0` needs 3.0-capable software at both ends. The container handles its own side either way: it runs 3.0 in userspace with the bundled `amneziawg-go`, and switches to the kernel datapath automatically when a 3.0-capable module is loaded on the host. The generated config is the same in both cases. Your peers need an AmneziaVPN app or amneziawg build that supports 3.0.

> [!NOTE]
> `AWG_VERSION=3.1` is a convenience preset, not a distinct parameter set. Upstream AWG 3.1 added two independent `[Interface]` switches on top of 3.0, and you can set either one with any `AWG_VERSION`. See [AWG 3.1 interface options](#awg-31-interface-options).

## Obfuscation parameters

Every value here is optional and random by default. Server and clients must agree on all of them, except the 3.0 timer ranges, where each side draws its own value.

| Parameter | Default | Constraints |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `-e AWG_JC=` | Random 3-8 | Junk packet count (1-128) |
| `-e AWG_JMIN=` | Random 40-80 | Min junk size in bytes. Must be < JMAX |
| `-e AWG_JMAX=` | Random 80-250 | Max junk size in bytes (max 1280) |
| `-e AWG_S1=` | Random 15-150 | Init padding bytes (max 1132). S1+56 must not equal S2 |
| `-e AWG_S2=` | Random 15-150 | Response padding bytes (max 1188) |
| `-e AWG_S3=` | Random 8-55 (2.0) / 12-55 (3.0) / 0 (1.5) | Cookie padding bytes (max 64) |
| `-e AWG_S4=` | Random 4-27 (2.0) / 12-27 (3.0) / 0 (1.5) | Transport padding bytes (max 32). Per-packet overhead, keep it small |
| `-e AWG_H1=` | Auto range (2.0) / int (1.5) | Header obfuscation. H1-H4 must be unique, all >= 5 |
| `-e AWG_H2=` | Auto range (2.0) / int (1.5) | AWG 2.0 uses range format (e.g. `90666522-140666522`) |
| `-e AWG_H3=` | Auto range (2.0) / int (1.5) | Single integers cause the Amnezia app to report AWG 1.5 |
| `-e AWG_H4=` | Auto range (2.0) / int (1.5) | |
| `-e AWG_I1=` | Auto QUIC Initial (2.0) / empty (1.5) | Custom protocol signature packet. See [tag reference](#custom-protocol-signatures-i1-i5) |
| `-e AWG_I2=` | empty | Requires I1 to be set |
| `-e AWG_I3=` | empty | |
| `-e AWG_I4=` | empty | |
| `-e AWG_I5=` | empty | |

### AWG 3.0 parameters

Generated only when `AWG_VERSION=3.0`. Timer values are `lo-hi` ranges and the endpoint picks a fresh random value inside the range, so the two sides do not have to match.

| Parameter | Default | Constraints |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `-e AWG_HEADER_PROTECTION_KEY=` | Auto-generated shared key | Encrypts packet headers. Must be identical on server and all clients. Requires S1-S4 >= 12 |
| `-e AWG_CONTENT_PADDING=` | Random range within 16-128 | Extra random padding per transport packet, `lo-hi` bytes. `0` disables |
| `-e AWG_REKEY_AFTER_TIME=` | Random range within 100-145s | Time before the initiator rekeys, `lo-hi` seconds (WireGuard default 120) |
| `-e AWG_REKEY_TIMEOUT=` | Random range within 4-10s | Handshake retransmit timeout, `lo-hi` seconds (default 5) |
| `-e AWG_REJECT_AFTER_TIME=` | Random range, derived | Keypair lifetime, `lo-hi` seconds (default 180). Must exceed RekeyAfterTime and KeepaliveTimeout + RekeyTimeout |
| `-e AWG_KEEPALIVE_TIMEOUT=` | Random range within 8-22s | Keepalive interval when idle, `lo-hi` seconds (default 10) |
| `-e AWG_MAX_HANDSHAKE_ATTEMPTS=` | Random range within 12-28 | Handshake retries before giving up, `lo-hi` count (default 18) |

### AWG 3.1 interface options

AWG 3.1 added two `[Interface]` booleans (`on` or `off`) rather than a new parameter set. They are independent of each other and of `AWG_VERSION`, so you can pair either one with `2.0` or `3.0`.

| Option | Env var | Effect | Must match on both ends |
|--------|---------|--------|:---:|
| `RandomTrailers` | `AWG_RANDOM_TRAILERS` | Appends a random number of random bytes to handshake initiation, response and cookie-reply packets, so those packets no longer have a fixed length. The trailer is drawn per packet to fill up to a 500-byte window | Yes |
| `DisableCookies` | `AWG_DISABLE_COOKIES` | Stops the endpoint from answering with cookie-reply messages when it is under load, which removes a distinctive response to probing. You give up WireGuard's built-in DoS mitigation in exchange | No |

The container writes whichever of these is `on` into the `[Interface]` block of the server conf and every peer conf, so both ends stay in step. Unset, or `off`, and the key is not written at all.

`AWG_VERSION=3.1` is shorthand for the 3.0 parameter set plus `AWG_RANDOM_TRAILERS=on`. `DisableCookies` is never turned on for you: it trades away WireGuard's DoS mitigation, and since it does not have to match between ends it is a per-deployment call rather than part of a protocol mode. Set it explicitly if you want it:

```yaml
      - AWG_VERSION=3.1
      - AWG_DISABLE_COOKIES=on
```

Setting a switch explicitly persists it like any other AWG parameter, so it survives a restart with the var removed. A switch that came only from the `3.1` preset does not: drop back to `AWG_VERSION=2.0` and `RandomTrailers` goes away with the rest of the 3.x keys, which is what you want when you are downgrading to get an older client connected again.

Either switch also works on its own, with any version:

```yaml
      - AWG_VERSION=2.0
      - AWG_RANDOM_TRAILERS=on
```

`RandomTrailers` changes the receive path as well as the send path. A peer without it expects handshake packets of exactly one length and drops the padded ones, so enable it on the server and every peer, or on none of them. Because the container writes it to every conf it generates, that holds automatically — but a peer conf you wrote by hand, or an older client, will not connect.

Both options need 3.1-capable software wherever they are used: the bundled userspace `amneziawg-go`, or [kernel module](https://github.com/amnezia-vpn/amneziawg-linux-kernel-module) v3.1.x on the host for the kernel datapath. On an older host module the tunnel fails to come up with `Unable to modify interface: Invalid argument` — the bundled `awg` parses the keys, and the kernel is what refuses them. (An `awg` build older than 3.1, which you would only meet outside this container, instead reports `Line unrecognized`.) The container reads `/sys/module/amneziawg/version` at startup and warns before either happens — but only when that file exists and holds a numeric version. A missing file, or a string it cannot read as a number (`v3.1.0`, a git-describe or distro-suffixed version), is passed over rather than guessed at, so no warning is not proof the module is new enough. Check it yourself if you are unsure.

To turn a switch back off, set it to `off` rather than removing it — removing the variable means "reuse the saved value", the same as every other `AWG_*` setting. `off` omits the key from the generated configs rather than writing `= off`; since off is the endpoint default anyway the two are equivalent, and omitting it keeps the config readable by an older amneziawg that does not know the key at all. That makes `AWG_RANDOM_TRAILERS=off` the way to rescue a tunnel these switches have broken, without leaving `AWG_VERSION=3.1`.

> [!NOTE]
> Earlier versions of this image did not generate these keys, so the documented workaround was to add them by hand to `/config/templates/server.conf` and `/config/templates/peer.conf`. If you did that, remove the hand-added lines and set the env vars instead — otherwise the key is written twice.

## Custom protocol signatures (I1-I5)

AWG 2.0 sends signature packets before the handshake to make VPN traffic look like some other UDP protocol. I1 defaults to a QUIC Initial packet (RFC 9000).

| Tag | Description | Example |
|-----|-------------|---------|
| `<b 0xHEX>` | Static hex bytes | `<b 0x170303>` |
| `<r N>` | N random bytes | `<r 32>` |
| `<rd N>` | N random digits | `<rd 8>` |
| `<rc N>` | N random chars (a-zA-Z) | `<rc 16>` |
| `<t>` | 32-bit Unix timestamp | |

[AmneziaWG Architect](https://architect.vai-rice.space/) generates signature strings for QUIC, DNS, DTLS, SIP, HTTP/3 and others.

## Custom SERVERPORT

The container always listens on 51820 inside the network namespace. `SERVERPORT` only changes what peer configs advertise, so map the external port onto 51820:

```yaml
environment:
  - SERVERPORT=32948
ports:
  - 32948:51820/udp  # NOT 32948:32948/udp
```

## Managing peers

```bash
docker exec amneziawg /app/show-peer 1 2 3
docker exec amneziawg /app/show-peer laptop phone tablet
```
