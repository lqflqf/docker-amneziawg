# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Summary

Docker container for AmneziaWG VPN built on LinuxServer.io base images with s6-overlay process supervision. Two modes: **server** (auto-generates configs when `PEERS` is set) and **client** (uses manual configs from `/config/wg_confs/`). The container brings up ALL `.conf` files in `/config/wg_confs/` on startup.

## Build & Test

```bash
# Build image locally
docker build -t amneziawg-test .

# Run server mode smoke test (tunnel won't work without /dev/net/tun — expected)
docker run -d --name awg-test --cap-add NET_ADMIN \
  -e PEERS=2 -e SERVERURL=test.example.com \
  -v /tmp/awg-test:/config amneziawg-test

# Verify config generation
docker logs awg-test
docker exec awg-test cat /config/wg_confs/wg0.conf
docker exec awg-test cat /config/peer1/peer1.conf
docker exec awg-test /app/show-peer 1

# Cleanup
docker rm -f awg-test && rm -rf /tmp/awg-test
```

There is no automated test suite. CI runs smoke tests on PRs: binary presence, s6 structure, show-peer executable check.

## Architecture

### Dockerfile: 3-stage multi-arch build

| Stage | Base | Output |
|---|---|---|
| `go-builder` | `golang:1.25.12-alpine` | `/src/amneziawg-go` (static binary, CGO) |
| `tools-builder` | `alpine:3.24` | `/usr/bin/awg` (compiled C) + `/usr/bin/awg-quick` (bash script copied from `src/wg-quick/linux.bash`) |
| runtime | `ghcr.io/linuxserver/baseimage-alpine:3.24` | Production image |

Runtime creates compatibility symlinks: `wg → awg`, `wg-quick → awg-quick`, `/etc/wireguard → /config/wg_confs`.

### s6-overlay service chain

```
init-config (LSIO) → init-amneziawg-module (oneshot) → init-amneziawg-confs (oneshot) → svc-coredns (longrun) → svc-amneziawg (oneshot)
```

- **init-amneziawg-module**: Tests kernel support via `ip link add dev test type amneziawg` (the amnezia module's rtnl link kind — awg-quick creates `type amneziawg`, not `type wireguard`). Falls back to `amneziawg-go` userspace (exports `WG_QUICK_USERSPACE_IMPLEMENTATION`).
- **init-amneziawg-confs**: Config generation using eval+heredoc template expansion from `/config/templates/`. Server mode generates keys, wg0.conf, peer configs, QR codes. Client mode disables CoreDNS.
- **svc-coredns**: Longrun CoreDNS service with `notification-fd 3` health checks. Auto-disabled if port 53 already bound (and `USE_COREDNS` not explicitly set) or `USE_COREDNS=false`. In client mode, defaults to `false` unless overridden. Disabling in server mode breaks DNS for peers using `PEERDNS=auto` — set `PEERDNS` to a public resolver.
- **svc-amneziawg**: Oneshot service (up/down scripts). Validates `[Interface]` in each .conf, activates tunnels, saves active confs to `/run/activeconfs` via `declare -p`. Finish script tears down in reverse order.

Dependencies are declared via empty files in `dependencies.d/`. Services are registered via empty files in `user/contents.d/`.

### Config persistence

All env vars are saved to `/config/.donoteditthisfile` (LinuxServer pattern) for change detection on restart. AWG obfuscation params are additionally saved to `/config/server/awg_params` and loaded as fallback (via `grep`/`cut`, NOT `source` — to preserve env var priority). Configs only regenerate if any saved var differs from the current value.

## Key Development Patterns

### s6-overlay scripts
- Shebang: `#!/usr/bin/with-contenv bash`
- Add `# shellcheck shell=bash` directive
- Must be `chmod +x`
- Use `lsiown -R abc:abc /config` for ownership (LinuxServer helper), fallback to `chown`

### Adding a new environment variable
1. Set default in `init-amneziawg-confs/run` main logic section
2. If persistent: add to `save_vars()` (as `ORIG_X`) AND the change detection `if` block
3. For AWG params: also add to `generate_awg_params()` save block AND `load_awg_params()` grep section
4. For config output: add to templates in `root/defaults/` (eval+heredoc expanded), `append_awg_signatures()` (server conf — appends after template, before peer blocks), or `append_awg_signatures_to_interface()` (peer confs — inserts before `[Peer]` using awk)
5. Document in `docker-compose.yml` (commented example) and `README.md`

### AWG obfuscation parameters
All clients and server must use identical values. Key constraints:
- `AWG_VERSION`: `"2.0"` (default, S3/S4 random, I1 randomly generated as QUIC Initial/DNS/DTLS), `"3.0"` (2.0 plus `HeaderProtectionKey`, `ContentPaddingAddition` and randomized timers; S1-S4 floors rise to 12), `"3.1"` (3.0 plus `RandomTrailers = on`) or `"1.5"` (S3=S4=0, no I1-I5)
- `AWG_VERSION` is deliberately **not** defaulted at the top of the script (`${AWG_VERSION:-}`); the `2.0` default is applied at the top of `generate_awg_params()`, after `load_awg_params()` has had a chance to restore the saved version. Defaulting early makes the `awg_params` fallback dead code and silently rewrites every peer conf as 2.0 when the env var is dropped
- Only `on` emits a 3.1 switch key; `off` omits it rather than writing `= off` (off is the endpoint default, so they are functionally identical, and omission stays parseable by an amneziawg that does not know the key). `off` is therefore the escape from a tunnel broken by these keys. An empty value cannot serve that role: **s6 drops empty variables from `container_environment`**, so `AWG_RANDOM_TRAILERS=` reaches the script as *absent*, which means "reuse the saved value". Do not build "clear this" semantics on empty env vars anywhere in these scripts
- Never compare `AWG_VERSION` against string literals — use the `awg_has_3x_params()` (3.0/3.1) and `awg_has_2x_features()` (2.0/3.0/3.1) predicates, so a new version only has to be added in one place
- AWG 3.0 params live in `[Interface]` and are written by `append_awg3_params()` (server conf) / `append_awg3_params_to_interface()` (peer confs), generated by `generate_awg3_params()`. Timer values are `lo-hi` ranges and may differ per side; `HeaderProtectionKey` must be identical everywhere
- AWG 3.1 adds two independent `[Interface]` booleans, `AWG_RANDOM_TRAILERS` and `AWG_DISABLE_COOKIES`, honoured with **any** `AWG_VERSION`. Written by `append_awg31_options()` / `append_awg31_options_to_interface()`, built by `awg31_options_block()`. Values pass through `normalize_awg_switch()`, which maps aliases to `on`/`off` and drops anything else with a warning (a bad value makes `awg setconf` reject the whole config). `AWG_VERSION=3.1` only defaults `AWG_RANDOM_TRAILERS` to `on`; `DisableCookies` is never enabled implicitly
- Only the **explicitly set** switch values are persisted to `awg_params` (`_rt_explicit`/`_dc_explicit`), not the effective ones. A `RandomTrailers` that came from the `3.1` preset must not survive a downgrade to `2.0` — otherwise a user dropping back to fix an old client still emits a key that client cannot parse. Change detection in `.donoteditthisfile` still compares the *effective* values, so flipping the preset regenerates confs
- `awg31_options_block()` returns its block via the `BLOCK_OUT` variable, not stdout: command substitution strips trailing newlines, which would glue the last switch onto the following `[Peer]` line and break `awg setconf`
- `check_awg31_kernel_support()` warns when the 3.1 switches are requested against a pre-3.1 host kernel module, read from `/sys/module/amneziawg/version`. Skipped when `WG_QUICK_USERSPACE_IMPLEMENTATION` is set, since the bundled `amneziawg-go` is a 3.1 build
- `Jmin < Jmax`, `Jmax ≤ 1280`
- `S1 ≤ 1132`, `S2 ≤ 1188`, `S1+56 ≠ S2`, `S3 ≤ 64`, `S4 ≤ 32` (S4 is per-packet overhead — keep small; `≤ 20` or full-size packets fragment at the default 1420 MTU)
- **`RandomTrailers` requires `S1 == S2 == S3 == S4` under AWG 2.0+.** Trailers relax the receiver's packet-type check to `>=` (`receive.c:51`), so the `H` ranges become the only discriminator and unequal `S` values make three of four branches read the type field at the wrong offset — ~3.5% of transport packets are dropped and upload collapses from ~100 to ~2 Mbit/s. `generate_awg_params()` draws one value for all four whenever `AWG_RANDOM_TRAILERS` resolves to `on` and `awg_has_2x_features`, and warns if a user pins them unequal. The switch normalization block therefore has to run *before* the S values are drawn — do not move it back. See [`docs/awg-performance.md`](docs/awg-performance.md)
- `ContentPaddingAddition` takes precedence over `RandomTrailers` on send (`send.c:254`) but not on receive (`receive.c:47`), so setting both gives the risk without the obfuscation. It also costs ~22% of download by defeating `UDP_GRO` batching — prefer `AWG_CONTENT_PADDING=0`
- `H1-H4` must be unique, all ≥ 5 (values 1-4 are standard WireGuard headers). **AWG 2.0 generates non-overlapping quadrant range pairs by default** (e.g., `H1=90666522-140666522`) — the Amnezia app uses range format to identify AWG 2.0; single integers cause it to report AWG 1.5. AWG 1.5 keeps single integers.
- `I1-I5` (AWG 2.0 signatures) use tag syntax with `=` signs — parse with `cut -d= -f2-` not `-f2`
- There is **no per-tag size limit** on `<r N>`/`<rc N>`/`<rd N>` in current AmneziaWG: the 1000-byte check lived only in amneziawg-go ≤ v0.2.15 (`device/awg/tag_generator.go:73`), removed in `0361c54` / PR #103; tools and the kernel module never had one. docs.amnezia.org still prints "≤ 1000", and some third-party parsers enforce it (observed: Keenetic, `invalid I1 value`, threshold unconfirmed). The default I1 keeps a single `<r 1178>` on purpose — do not "fix" it, and do not add a size check to the container's validation. A split `<r 1000><r 178>` is wire-identical (adjacent random tags are one contiguous run; I1-I5 are send-only), which is why it is a router-side workaround, not an I1 change. See `CONTEXT.md` "`<r N>` size"

## Conventions

- Commit messages: conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`)
- Branch naming: `feature/your-feature-name`
- Indentation: 4 spaces for shell scripts and s6-overlay files, 2 spaces for Dockerfile and YAML (see `.editorconfig`)
- `root/defaults/server.conf` and `peer.conf` are eval+heredoc templates — they use `${VAR}` and `$(cat ...)` syntax that gets expanded at runtime via `eval "$(printf %s) cat <<DUDE ... DUDE"` (matching LinuxServer docker-wireguard pattern). Users can customize templates in `/config/templates/`

## CI/CD

### Workflows

**`docker-build.yml`** — main build pipeline:
- A `changes` gate job diffs each push/PR first: only `Dockerfile`, `root/**`, `.dockerignore` and the workflow itself are image content, so docs/skills/compose-only pushes skip the build and release entirely. The gate is an explicit `git diff` job, NOT an `on.push.paths` filter — path filters share the `push` block with the `v*` tag trigger and behave ambiguously for tag pushes, which could silently break semver releases. Tags, `workflow_dispatch`, and diffs with no reachable base all fail open (build)
- Push to `master`/`main` touching image paths → builds multi-arch (`amd64`, `arm64`) and pushes to `ghcr.io/ayastrebov/docker-amneziawg:latest` + upstream tools version tag, then creates a GitHub Release tagged with the tools version (skipped if the release already exists)
- `v*` tags → semantic version tags (`1.0.0`, `1.0`, `1`)
- PRs → smoke tests only (single-platform `--load` build, no multi-arch QEMU): binaries, s6 structure, service types, dependency chain, CoreDNS, branding
- Upstream versions are read from the Dockerfile `ARG` pins (single source of truth); `workflow_dispatch` accepts `amneziawg_go_version` and `amneziawg_tools_version` overrides for one-off builds

**`upstream-check.yml`** — daily upstream version check (06:00 UTC):
- Compares `ARG` defaults in Dockerfile against latest amneziawg-tools and amneziawg-go releases
- If new version detected: updates Dockerfile and opens a pull request; the build workflow runs on merge

### Versioning

Container images are tagged with the upstream `amneziawg-tools` version (e.g., `1.0.20260223`). Both upstream versions are pinned as `ARG` defaults at the top of the Dockerfile:
- `AMNEZIAWG_GO_VERSION` — amneziawg-go tag (e.g., `v0.2.16`)
- `AMNEZIAWG_TOOLS_VERSION` — amneziawg-tools release (e.g., `v1.0.20260223`)

## Common Gotchas

- `local` keyword is only valid inside functions — don't use in main script body
- `awg-quick` is a bash script, not compiled — it's copied from upstream `src/wg-quick/linux.bash`
- Exit code 137 on container stop is normal (SIGKILL), not an error
- The Dockerfile patches `awg-quick` to skip setting `src_valid_mark` sysctl if already set
- Do NOT use `source` to load `awg_params` — it overrides Docker env vars. Use `grep`/`cut` with `${VAR:-fallback}` pattern
- Peer naming: numeric peers → `peer1`, `peer2`; named peers → `peer_laptop`, `peer_phone` (underscore prefix, matching LinuxServer)
- `INTERFACE` is derived from `INTERNAL_SUBNET` (e.g., `10.13.13` from `10.13.13.0`) — not a separate env var
- `svc-amneziawg` is a oneshot (not longrun) — tunnels stay up without a running process
- Container branding: `root/etc/s6-overlay/s6-rc.d/init-adduser/branding` + `LSIO_FIRST_PARTY=false` in Dockerfile
- I1-I5 must be in `[Interface]` in peer confs, not `[Peer]` — the Amnezia app only checks `[Interface]` for version detection. `append_awg_signatures_to_interface()` handles this via awk insertion before `[Peer]`. The server conf is fine with append since peer blocks haven't been added yet when signatures are written.
- The container never writes `MTU`; `awg-quick` derives `route MTU − 80` = 1420, which ignores `S4` and fragments full-size packets when `S4 > 20` (IPv4) or on IPv6 endpoints. `ContentPaddingAddition`/transport `RandomTrailers` are capped at the observed UDP window (NOT the MTU — the window counts received datagrams too, so full-size sends grow slightly) and do not fragment transport packets; kernel modules built before `4569c4c6` (2026-09-06) appended trailers to I1-I5/junk packets too, producing rare oversized handshake-burst packets. That fix did not bump `version.h` — a patched module still reports `3.1.20260812` — so never gate on the date component of `/sys/module/amneziawg/version`; `check_awg31_kernel_support()` only reads the `3.1` major/minor, which is fine. See `docs/awg-performance.md`. README "MTU" is the user-facing guidance: 1280 for ordinary paths, `path − 60/80 − S4` when the path itself is constrained (a true 1280-byte path needs 1208/1188, not 1280).
- Custom `SERVERPORT` requires port mapping `SERVERPORT:51820/udp` (not `SERVERPORT:SERVERPORT/udp`) — the container always listens on 51820 internally regardless of `SERVERPORT`.
- `SYS_MODULE` does NOT enable the kernel datapath. `init-amneziawg-module/run` never calls `modprobe` — it only probes whether the `amneziawg` module is already active on the host via `ip link add ... type amneziawg` (the amnezia module registers link kind `amneziawg`; a plain `wireguard` module is never used because `awg-quick` creates `type amneziawg` and otherwise falls back to userspace `amneziawg-go`). The init script even logs "you can remove the SYS_MODULE capability" once the module is active. Keep `SYS_MODULE` only on minimal hosts that don't auto-load iptables NAT modules. `/lib/modules:/lib/modules` bind mount is a no-op for this container.
