"""awg-lint.py — check AmneziaWG configs for constraint and performance bugs.

Usage:
    awg-lint.py wg0.conf [peer1.conf ...]

One file is checked on its own. Given several, the shared obfuscation values are
also cross-checked, since a server and its peers must agree on S/H/I,
HeaderProtectionKey and RandomTrailers or the tunnel will not come up.

Exit status is 1 if any ERROR was reported, 0 otherwise (warnings do not fail).
